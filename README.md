## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview

Hospital Management System is a web-based application built with React to manage patient records, doctor schedules, appointments, and billing. It provides a user-friendly interface for hospital staff to access and manage medical data efficiently.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Features Overviews

### Core Functionalities:

- **üè• Patient Management** ‚Äì Add, update, delete, and view patient details.
- **üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor Schedules** ‚Äì View available doctors and their appointment slots.
- **üìÖ Appointments** ‚Äì Book, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
- **üí∞ Billing System** ‚Äì Generate and view invoices for patient treatments.
- **üìä Dashboard** ‚Äì View an overview of hospital operations and patient statistics.

### Authentication:

1. **Store API Token in Cookies**:

- When the user logs in or authenticates, the API will return an access token (and a refresh token, if applicable).
- These tokens are stored securely in cookies, typically using HttpOnly cookies for added security. The HttpOnly flag ensures that the cookie is not accessible via JavaScript, mitigating potential XSS attacks.

2. **Send Token in Every Request**:

- For each subsequent request, the token stored in the cookie is automatically sent along with the request. This can be done by attaching the token to the Authorization header or by letting the browser include the cookie with every request automatically if it's set as withCredentials: true.

3. **Automatically Refresh Token if Expired**:

- When an access token expires (typically after a certain period), a 401 Unauthorized response will be triggered.
- The system will attempt to refresh the token using a refresh token (if available). The refresh request is sent to an endpoint that returns a new access token.
  Once the token is refreshed, the failed request is retried with the new token.
